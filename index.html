<h3><strong>A natural satellite, or moon, is, in the most common usage, an astronomical body that orbits a planet or minor planet (or sometimes another small Solar System body).</strong></h3>
<p>In the Solar System, there are six planetary satellite systems containing 205 known natural satellites.
Four IAU-listed dwarf planets are also known to have natural satellites: Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. As of September 2018, there are 334 other minor planets known to have moons.
The Earth–Moon system is unique among planetary systems in that the ratio of the diameter of the Moon to the diameter of Earth is much greater than that of any other natural-satellite–planet ratio
in the Solar System. At 3,474 km (2,158 miles) across, the Moon is 0.273 times the diameter of Earth. This is five times greater than the next largest moon-to-planet diameter ratio
(with Neptune's largest moon at 0.055, Saturn's at 0.044, Jupiter's at 0.038 and Uranus' as 0.031). For the category of planetoids, among the five that are known in the Solar System,
Charon has the largest ratio, being half (0.52) the diameter of Pluto.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 22px;">
There is no established lower limit on what is considered a "moon". Every natural celestial body with an identified orbit around a planet of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System" target="_blank" title="Solar System,Wikipedia">Solar System</a>,
some as small as a kilometer across, has been considered a moon, though objects a tenth that size within Saturn's rings, which have not been directly observed,
have been called moonlets. Small asteroid moons (natural satellites of asteroids), such as Dactyl, have also been called <I>moonlets</I>.
The upper limit is also vague. Two orbiting bodies are sometimes described as a double planet rather than primary and satellite. Asteroids such as 90 Antiope are considered double asteroids,
but they have not forced a clear definition of what constitutes a moon. Some authors consider the Pluto–Charon system to be a double (dwarf) planet.
The most common dividing line on what is considered a moon rests upon whether the barycentre is below the surface of the larger body, though this is somewhat arbitrary,
because it depends on distance as well as relative mass.</p>
