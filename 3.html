<h3><strong>Callisto /kəˈlɪstoʊ/, or Jupiter IV, is the second-largest moon of Jupiter, after Ganymede.</strong></h3>
<p>It is the third-largest moon in the Solar System after Ganymede and Saturn's largest moon Titan, and the largest object in the Solar System that may not be properly differentiated.
  Callisto was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei. At 4821 km in diameter, Callisto has about 99% the diameter of the planet Mercury but only about a third of its mass.
  It is the fourth Galilean moon of Jupiter by distance, with an orbital radius of about 1883000 km. It is not in an orbital resonance like the three other Galilean satellites—Io,
  Europa, and Ganymede—and is thus not appreciably tidally heated. Callisto's rotation is tidally locked to its orbit around Jupiter, so that the same hemisphere always faces inward.
  Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Callisto's surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead.
  It is less affected by Jupiter's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere" target="_blank" title="Magnetosphere,Wikipedia">magnetosphere</a> than the other inner satellites because of its more remote orbit, located just outside Jupiter's main radiation belt.</p>

  Callisto is surrounded by an extremely thin atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide and probably molecular oxygen, as well as by a rather intense ionosphere.
  Callisto is thought to have formed by slow accretion from the disk of the gas and dust that surrounded Jupiter after its formation.
  Callisto's gradual accretion and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough heat was available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto,
  which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100–150 km and a small, rocky core.
  The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto leaves open the possibility that it could harbor life. However, conditions are thought to be less favorable than on nearby Europa.
Various space probes from Pioneers 10 and 11 to <I>Galileo</I> and <I>Cassini</I> have studied Callisto. Because of its low radiation levels,
Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jovian system.</p>
